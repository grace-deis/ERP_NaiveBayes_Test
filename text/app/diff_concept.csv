That is why the Labour Government repealed not a single piece of union legislation during their 13 years in power.

We are lucky enough to have generous travel expenses so that we can hire a car or a taxi when there is a transport strike. We have secure jobs, where we get paid whether we make it into the office or not. Even a Back Bencher is among the top 5% of UK earners, so  we can afford to deal with the childcare costs that might come with a school closure or some disruption. But what about the low-paid restaurant staff who miss a day's work and a day's pay because of a stoppage called by a handful of transport workers? What about the self-employed builder who has to turn down a week-long job because a strike by teachers means that his kids cannot go to school?

The whole point of strikes is to cause disruption, but the impact of industrial action on ordinary people—often the very working people whom unions were created to support—is such that it should ever be used only as a last resort. It should be taken only after the explicit backing of a majority of members. That is why this Bill sets a minimum turnout of 50% for industrial action ballots. If 1,000 union members are being asked to participate in a strike, at least 500 of them must vote for the ballot to be valid.","BALANC","BALANC"
"I also wish to highlight the additional requirement for ballots of staff in six key sectors: the health service, the fire service,  border security and nuclear decommissioning—because of the obvious risks to public safety and security—and education and transport.

If union members truly want to do so, I will not stand in their way.

"One of the valuable roles performed by unions over the years has been to defend workers from abuse, bullying and harassment at the hands of managers. There is no place for such behaviour in the modern workplace, and I applaud anyone who stands up against it. But bosses are not the only culprits. The independent Carr report contained shocking accounts of appalling bullying and harassment directed at non-strikers by trade union members. There were threats that included details of where workers' children go to school, and abusive text messages warning, ""We know where you live.â€ Photographs of non-strikers were posted online in a bid to shame them. Workers who had failed to support industrial action reported being punished by colleagues who deliberately saddled them with antisocial shift patterns or isolated them in the workplace.

It is not acceptable for managers to harass and abuse trade union members who take lawful industrial action. Nor is it acceptable for strikers to treat those who choose to work in the same way. While such abuses are doubtless the actions of a tiny minority of trade unionists, they should never be allowed to happen without consequences. The Bill makes it clear that such intimidation has no place in the modern workplace.","PHYSICAL","PHYSICAL"

After all, freedom to choose without having all the facts is no freedom at all.

The Bill allows the Government to make regulations extending that to all public sector employers.

We have already made considerable savings for the taxpayer by requiring Departments to publish this information, as we have just heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (James Heappey).

"Thirdly, the Bill works to redress the balance between striking and non-striking workers through the proposals to minimise the disruption caused by strike action.

Interestingly, the measures taken then have never been repealed by the Labour party. I am absolutely clear which side I am on and which side the Conservative party is on.

It is clear that when tough decisions have to be made, communication is the key to an effective and productive workplace culture. We do need to accept, however, that occasionally we will not agree, no matter how much discussion we have had—that is a fact of life—and no Bill will make employers and staff agree on everything.","RELATE","RELATE"

May I encourage the Minister to include in clause 6(1), on information to the certification officer, a provision about the outcome of the industrial action? That information is useful for members, too.

Fifty-four people were balloted. Of those, only 14 could be bothered to vote. Five voted for a strike and nine for action short of a strike.

"]  Let me be very clear to the House, to the Minister and to my constituents: I am against the Bill and will vote against it this evening.","ECONOMIC","nonstatement"
"What I said to the Minister was that IÃ¢â‚¬â€and, I am sure, many peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€think it reasonable for there to be a minimum level of service from our emergency services during a period of strike action, and I encouraged him to pursue that via discussion with the relevant services and trade unions, not by threatening them with the prospect of an effective statutory ban on their right to strike.","RIGHTS","nonstatement"
"When I asked the Minister whether he had sought to achieve that before introducing the legislation, he was unable to fully answer my question.","REPLIC","nonstatement"
"As we have already heard this evening, the rationale for the Bill is therefore in question.","ADEQ","nonstatement"
"The Government say that the legislation in place is not effective and that voluntary agreements cannot be sought, but that is not correct.","PHYSICAL","nonstatement"
"Indeed, in signing off the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill and its compliance with the European convention on human rights, even the Government said:  Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the case of other key public services, important factors exist to mitigate the impacts of industrial actionÃ¢â‚¬Â.","RIGHTS","nonstatement"
"So what has changed?","ADEQ","nonstatement"
"As we have already heard, section 240 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it a criminal offence and a breach of employment contract to strike if doing so puts someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in danger or puts them at risk of serious injury.","LEGAL","nonstatement"
"That is why we have statutory guidance in place across public services, and it is why trade unions put life-and-limb service provision in place when they organise strikes with management.","ADEQ","nonstatement"
"On voluntary agreements, in December last year and this month, such agreements have been put in place.","ADEQ","nonstatement"
"As far as I am awareÃ¢â‚¬â€from speaking with striking nurses at Southmead Hospital in my constituency, and later with senior managementÃ¢â‚¬â€there were no problems with those voluntary service arrangements, so the law is in place, voluntary agreements are in place, and there is no rationale for the Bill.","ADEQ","nonstatement"
"We can therefore only conclude that it is a negotiating tacticÃ¢â‚¬â€a threatÃ¢â‚¬â€by the Government.","RIGHTS","nonstatement"
"Lastly, my Committee was disappointed by the lack of time for scrutinising the Bill.","ADEQ","nonstatement"
"Once again, Ministers have introduced primary legislation with wide-ranging discretionary powers for Ministers without publishing the details of vital secondary legislation in a timely manner.","POWER","nonstatement"
"That is unacceptable.","REPLIC","nonstatement"
"It is poor practice for Ministers to bring legislation to the House in that way.","POWER","nonstatement"
"As the Regulatory Policy Committee confirmed for me today, the Government are obliged to publish an impact assessment so that that Committee can inform the House of the impact of legislation proposed by Ministers.","REPLIC","nonstatement"
"However, Ministers have not given the Regulatory Policy Committee the time to review the GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact assessment and then inform the House about the consequences of the legislation.","REPLIC","nonstatement"
"So not only do we have a Bill that has no evidence-based rationale for the need to legislate on voluntary agreements, but we have a Government rushing through the legislation without following due process and without drafting it to the standard that this House requires.","ADEQ","nonstatement"
"It is clearly a rushed threat, it is unacceptable and it shows disregard for the House and the job that we have to do as parliamentarians to ensure that the law is passed effectively.","POLIT","nonstatement"
"To summarise, can the Minister confirm that the Government will publish the statutory instruments and the impact assessment before the Bill finishes its passage through this House?","ADEQ","nonstatement"
