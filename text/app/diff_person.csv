"However, I rise to speak to Amendment 335, standing in my name, which would introduce a sunset clause ensuring that the Act will expire after three years unless the Secretary of State demonstrates that it has led to a net increase in employment. I do so against a background of economic data emerging in recent months painting a deeply concerning picture of the UK labour market. The UK’s jobless rate ticked up to 4.6% in April, while payrolled employment has fallen sharply, according to official figures covering the period when the Budget tax hikes on businesses came into effect.

"Just as the workplace has evolved and improved since that time, so the trade unions and the laws that govern them have developed too. I hope that, in 2015, no one would argue for the return of the closed shop, the show-of-hands votes in dimly lit car parks or the wildcat walk-outs enforced by a handful of heavies.

"I also want to talk about the impact on taxpayers, who have to fund the salaries of public servants, only for those public servants to spend their time on trade union business.

","Stephen Doughty","Stewart McDonald"
"On political funds, first we will increase transparency on the way in which political funds are spent, helping members to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to contribute. The Bill places a duty on unions to report in greater detail on what annual expenditure over �2,000 is useful, helping members decide whether or not they want to pay into the fund. After all, freedom to choose without having all the facts is no freedom at all.

Secondly, unions will need to obtain the active consent of members to deduct a political levy. At present, members can, in theory, opt out, although many unions do not even tell new members that the political levy exists, let alone about them having to pay for it.
","Sajid Javid","Sajid Javid"
" Does the Secretary of State accept that the political fund is not just about putting money into political parties, but about holding the Government of the day to account?
","Greg Smith","Peter Kyle"
"Does my right hon. Friend agree that this is a simple matter of transparency? If people want to give money to the Labour party as union members, they should choose to do so. Indeed, if they do not actually choose to do so, the danger is that the unions are arguably guilty of mis-selling, because people do not know what they are buying when they join up for membership of a trade union.
","Sajid Javid","Oliver Dowden"
" There is no transparency around how much time they spend on union work and no controls in place to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money. It is a situation that most ordinary Britons, including many dedicated public servants I have spoken to, find absolutely baffling. That is why civil service Departments are already required to publish information about the use of facility time by their staff. The Bill allows the Government to make regulations extending that to all public sector employers. It will include information about an employer�s spending on trade union duties and activities and about how many of its union representatives spend a specified percentage of their time on their union role. We have already made considerable savings for the taxpayer by requiring Departments to publish this information, as we have just heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (James Heappey). However, if transparency alone  does not lead to further savings, the Bill also grants Ministers the power to set a cap on the time and money spent on facility time.","Huw Merriman","Sajid Javid"
"There is nothing wrong with facility time�the Bill is clear about that�but it should be open and transparent, and the current rules do not ensure that.

"She says, rightly, that the number of days lost to strikes in the UK is at its lowest for 20 years. It is even more significant than that: we lose fewer days to strike action in the UK today than we did during the second world war. There is no problem here that needs fixing.","Geraint Davies","Jonathan Reynolds"
" Clauses 2 and 3 are deliberately designed to undermine the bargaining power of trade unions by requiring minimum turnouts, thresholds and support before a strike ballot is valid. The new proposals demand a mandate for unions that breaks the democratic conventions of our society by counting votes not cast as essentially no votes.","Angela Eagle","Angela Eagle"
"Given the serious questions about its effect on fundamental rights, the Bill may be open to legal challenge on a number of fronts, including its impact on the devolution settlements, because it covers areas such as health and education that are clearly devolved. The Welsh Government, who have a substantially better record of working constructively with trade unions than this Administration, have objected to the proposals in strong terms, and are considering whether a legislative consent motion might be appropriate.","Stephen Doughty","Angela Eagle"
"Is he aware that many trade unions have political funds but donate not a single penny to the Labour party? The Minister spoke of union members not having a say, but a ballot on political funds has to be held every 10 years. People can opt out of paying the political levy at any time during their membership.
","Sajid Javid","Kevan Jones"
"That is a long way from today�s practice of using members for their leadership�s own political games. The public are tired of it, and these reforms are now being demanded. I believe that there needs to be a distinction between the public and private sectors, but fundamentally I want all workers to be properly represented in the workplace, independent of party politics.","Sajid Javid","Alec Shelbrooke"
" The Bill will lead to a deterioration of good industrial relations and it has no support within public opinion. It is designed to reduce civil liberties and human rights.","Chris Stephens","Chris Stephens"
" If the Government are going to introduce thresholds, they need to consider securing workplace balloting, which could be easily sorted out by Electoral Reform Services, or online voting.","Sajid Javid","Chris Stephens"
"These measures are entirely sensible and will prevent the abuse of working people.","Justin Madders","Boris Johnson"
"the Bill does not say that there are industries in which strikes should not take place, it is an effort to affect  millions of trade unionists and inhibit their right to strike because of a dispute involving a few thousand people at London Underground.","Grant Shapps","Alan Johnson"
"Another aspect of the Bill is the attempt to make processes involved in picketing part of criminal rather than civil law. It is designed to address allegations of picket line intimidation, but the Carr review, set up by the Conservatives under the coalition Government to investigate such allegations, specifically said that it could  find no evidence of intimidation.","Kevin Barron","Alan Johnson"
"The major aspects of the Bill will breach the legally binding undertakings that UK Governments have signed up to through the International Labour Organisation","Stephen Doughty","Alan Johnson"
"The Bill runs contrary to a British sense of fair play and common sense. It will increase bureaucracy and burdens of regulation, and it will be counterproductive to the Government�s stated aims of improving efficiency and productivity.","Ian Wright","Ian Wright"
"The Bill will not help us become more prosperous. If anything, it runs the risk of making industrial action more disruptive and the British economy less productive and less attractive to inward investment.","Ian Wright","Ian Wright"
"Paradoxically, the Bill might result in more working days lost to industrial action and a failure to address the pressing economic challenge of improving productivity. In a modern economy, surely the most appropriate approach is collaboration rather than confrontation.
","Margaret Greenwood","Ian Wright"
"The ability of Nissan to win the internal competition to build the new Juke earlier this month is testimony to continuous improvement, a drive towards efficiency and constantly rising quality levels, which are possible only through effective collaboration between management and unions.
","Kirsten Oswald","Ian Wright"
"There is also something sinister about the state�s collecting information on what might be private disputes between the employer and workforce that could be resolved relatively early in the negotiation process.","Richard Fuller","Ian Wright"
"Other sensible measures in the Bill are clauses 7 and 8, which set an expiry date on industrial action ballot mandates and extend the notice period that unions must give employers from seven to 14 days. The latter will give more time to reach settlements, which can only be a good thing for all parties concerned, while giving those adversely affected, such as commuters and parents, time to make other arrangements, whereas the former is a common-sense measure given the present situation of having effectively rolling mandates that can last for years and might be ongoing long after the members who originally voted for them have left employment.
","William Wragg","Andrew Bridgen"
"I turn next to clause 12 and the issue of facility time. I believe that in an increasingly transparent world, with the publication by public bodies of items of expenditure over �500, it is only right that trade union activity, effectively subsidised by the taxpayers, is subject to the same scrutiny, particularly at a time of reduced budgets.","William Wragg","Andrew Bridgen"
"I welcome the enhancement of the role of the certification officer, and it is again a common-sense reform for officers to be able to act on information or concerns they have received from a third party. In addition, I welcome the fact that they have specific investigatory powers to regulate trade unions in order to make this legislation workable.","Grahame Morris","Andrew Bridgen"
"Given the make-up of the Labour leadership team, this Bill is vital to protect the rights of all working people who seek to go to work, to raise their family and to contribute to this country, free of politically motivated strikes, unnecessary disruption and threats from union officials to topple a democratically elected Government enacting the mandate given to them by the British people as recently as this May. I am therefore happy to endorse the Bill as another step forward to greater economic prosperity for this country.","Andrew Bridgen","Andrew Bridgen"
"A trade union should be, I believe, a body that concerns itself with the rights and welfare of its members. It should be an organisation that strives to improve the working lives of people. It should always seek to work in partnership with employers, engaging in constructive dialogue and discussion. What a trade union should not be is a deliberately destructive force, seeking to hold back the economy of the country and unduly inconvenience, or�worse still�endanger other members of society.","Sajid Javid","William Wragg"
"I completely reject those comments. There is nothing in this Bill that is offensive: it is a moderate Bill that is attempting to balance the rights�[Interruption.] Absolutely, it is a moderate Bill that is balancing the right to strike with the rights of people who are trying to earn a living in difficult circumstances, and trying to get to work or go about their daily business.","Grant Shapps","Rishi Sunak"
"Does my hon. Friend agree that the context of this Bill is that it is intended to deal with the problem of a 77% increase in the loss of working days over recent times? Last year alone the number of days lost to industrial action was higher than the average of the 1990s and 2000s.","Chris Philp","Suella Fernandes"
"I agree with my hon. Friend. In today�s world, it is important that we maintain a competitive economy and increase employment, and having trade union legislation that is updated for that modern economy is vital if trade unions are to ensure their relevance in today�s economy.","Grant Shapps","Rishi Sunak"
"In sum, this Bill ensures that unions can continue to play a valuable role, doing the work they do best while operating with the transparency, fairness and democracy they need to retain the public�s confidence. This is not a Bill against trade unions, it is a moderate Bill that balances the rights of unions and people working across this country, and I commend it to the House.","Alan Mak","Rishi Sunak"
"The Tories have made a big thing about opposing identity cards, but now demand that trade unionists have them as well as armbands to help single them out, yet it is unclear how compliance with these and other requirements are connected to the prevention of intimidation of non-striking workers. Laws already exist which prevent that and unions must comply with a detailed statutory code of practice.","Sajid Javid","Alex Cunningham"
"and many others now facing the prospect of losing their job as deeper cuts to the public sector continue to bite.","Grant Shapps","Alex Cunningham"
"The ability of workers to withdraw labour is fundamental to our democracy and I am not aware of any democracy elsewhere in the world that imposes such severe restrictions on legitimate industrial action. It is worth remembering that the UK already has one of the most regulated systems of industrial action in the world.","Lisa Cameron","Alex Cunningham"
"I would also welcome any clarity the Minister can provide around how he intends to escape the inevitable confusion arising when attempting to ballot a workplace where some occupations are covered by the �important public services� provisions and others are not. Will the Minister give further details on the requirement for �reasonably detailed� information to be provided on ballot papers? If a failure to provide such information is to be a basis for legal action by employers against workers taking industrial action, it is crucial that the House should be informed in advance of how �reasonably detailed� is to be defined","Sajid Javid","Alex Cunningham"
"The Bill will create substantial legal and administrative costs for unions, which will be required to report annually to the certification officer on levels of industrial action and on how political funds have been used. This is on top of additional cost burdens elsewhere, should the changes to check-off procedures and facility time pass unamended.","Sajid Javid","Alex Cunningham"
"When trade unions choose to go on strike, it is often other workers who are adversely affected by the industrial action.","Oliver Dowden","Oliver Dowden"
"It simply seeks to balance the interests of the workers in the trade union against those of other workers who are subjected to the effects of the strike.","Oliver Dowden","Oliver Dowden"
"I am not saying that that should never happen, but the Bill will rightly set a balance in three important respects.
","Oliver Dowden","Oliver Dowden"
"People join unions for a variety of reasons, but they often do not wish to give money to the Labour party. There should be a simple principle that if a union wishes to give the party money, its members should be able actively to choose to do so, in much the same way as if they were making a direct donation to the party. I see no unfairness in that. I am simply saying that if people support the Labour party, they should be able to choose to give it money.","Sajid Javid","Oliver Dowden"
"Interestingly, given where the Labour party is at this stage, Labour Members have a choice: are they going to embrace the modern world and be on the side of workers�people in their constituencies who go out to work every day and do not want to be disrupted �or are they going to go back to the same old arguments that we thought had been settled 20 or 30 years ago? Interestingly, the measures taken then have never been repealed by the Labour party. I am absolutely clear which side I am on and which side the Conservative party is on. We are on the side of ordinary, hard-working people, while maintaining the right to strike. That is why I shall be voting in favour of this legislation.","Sajid Javid","Oliver Dowden"
"I also come here, however, as someone who knows that the most challenging situations and all the difficult discussions were entirely more productive and more effective, and carried more weight, because they were dealt with in partnership with trade unions. I did not always agree with my trade union counterparts, and they certainly did not always agree with me, but that is surely the point: sometimes there will be different perspectives, and that is entirely healthy and appropriate. It is clear that when tough decisions have to be made, communication is the key to an effective and productive workplace culture. We do need to accept, however, that occasionally we will not agree, no matter how much discussion we have had�that is a fact of life�and no Bill will make employers and staff agree on everything.","Grant Shapps","Kirsten Oswald"
"First, on the issue of the 40% additional threshold, I am pleased that the Government are looking at consultation, but the points made about the ability of the union leadership to control and minimise wildcat strikes do carry quite a weight. It would be interesting for the Minister to consider whether the notice period of 14 days before strike action will achieve most of the goals that are seen as required for that 40% threshold. May I encourage the Minister to include in clause 6(1), on information to the certification officer, a provision about the outcome of the industrial action? That information is useful for members, too. If they are asked to go on strike, they should know what the consequence of the strike was�what they achieved by it�so they can see whether such action is playing a good role.","Sajid Javid","Richard Fuller"
"This is a Bill of naked discrimination against the trade unions, designed to cut the funding of the Labour party severely and, thus, to entrench the Tory party in power, as well as to make it almost impossible to strike in certain industrial sectors.","Andy McDonald","Michael Meacher"
"However, it is worth quoting the stated purposes of the Bill, which the Government pretend are their motives. The first is to

�pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by 2030�.

That is beyond satire. The truth is that after seven years of austerity following the great crash wages are still 6% below pre-crash levels, productivity is flat, the FTSE 100 companies are not investing and household debt is now tipping �2 trillion. The idea that after this Bill we will be overtaking Germany and the United States in the next 15 years is ludicrous.
","Margaret Greenwood","Michael Meacher"
"It is true that most employers are probably decent and reasonable, but there are a distinct minority of them who are intransigent and who behave thoroughly unreasonably and badly. To penalise and intimidate workers in such cases, when it is the employer who has overwhelmingly caused the breakdown in industrial relations, is wholly unfair and wrong.","Rishi Sunak","Michael Meacher"
"We on the Conservative Benches pledged in our manifesto to tackle this issue, and I am pleased that the Conservative Government have put this Bill before the House so speedily. Clause 2 introduces a 50% voting threshold, which is essential to ensure that a small vocal minority is not able to exert undue influence in often quite tense industrial disputes.","Stephen Doughty","David Rutley"
"It is right that there is a second test, particularly in the more essential public services. Disproportionate disruption can be caused to people who have no say in the calling of that strike. It is important that we ensure that the rights of those who use the service�the public�are taken into account just as much as those who are calling the strike, particularly given the recent tube strikes.","Grant Shapps","David Rutley"
"I declare my interest as a member of Unite the union. The Bill exposes the Government�s self-appointed title as the workers� party and their claim to be the party for working people as little more than empty rhetoric devised by the spin doctors at Tory HQ. It is a total misnomer to claim to be the party for working people while simultaneously steamrolling over those very workers� democratic rights and civil liberties","Andrew Bridgen","Andy McDonald"
"The Government are carrying out this attack on trade unions not for practical reasons supported by evidence, but out of their ideological commitment to fighting the battles of generations past and to pursuing their mission to weaken and destroy the labour and trade union movement.","Chris Stephens","Andy McDonald"
"Even Margaret Thatcher, a Prime Minister whose term was defined by her opposition to the trade union movement, considered the proposals such as the ones set out in this Bill to be too extreme. She said that

�legislation on this subject, which would affect the funding of the Labour party, would create great unease and should not be entered into lightly.�","Wes Streeting","Andy McDonald"
"These proposals are so unreasonable and extreme that they will undoubtedly raise the serious prospect of legal challenge. The interference of the state in the affairs of trade unions is counter to article 11 of the European convention on human rights. We are signatories to the European social charter and as a nation we agreed in article 5 that our national laws would not restrict the freedom of workers to form and join organisations for the protection of their economic and social interests. The Bill directly contravenes our country�s commitment under the charter.","Cat Smith","Andy McDonald"
"
Strikes have a profound effect on other members of society, which is why it is appropriate to put in place a reasonable threshold before strike action can be taken. For example, exactly a year ago Unison�s NHS staff voted for strike action on a turnout of 16% and with 11% of the membership voting in favour. I do not think that mandate is strong enough to merit inconveniencing tens of thousands of patients and potentially having operations postponed.","Sajid Javid","Chris Philp"
"I remind those Members who oppose the Bill that a YouGov poll conducted only four weeks ago found that 53% of Londoners are in favour of these measures and only 26% are opposed.","Chris Stephens","Chris Philp"
"Why are we debating the Bill today? Is there any urgency for these provisions, or any demand resulting from the parliamentary timetable? No, there is not. We all know why we are here today. We are here today because the Government deliberately timetabled the Bill�s Second Reading to coincide with the first full day of the Trades Union Congress, when those MPs who are proud trade unionists, as I am, would have been in Brighton talking with working people about the issues that really matter, such as low pay, zero-hours contracts, inequality and insecurity at work. Instead, we are here to discuss this shabby, shameful Bill. That shows the Government�s contempt not only for trade unions, but for democracy.
","Gregory Stafford","Jo Stevens"
"I will finish with a point about devolution and the inadequacies of the Bill. The Bill deals with public services that are devolved to Wales, including the way public sector bodies work with trade unions to ensure effective delivery of services to the public, including my constituents in Cardiff Central. Therefore, I ask the Secretary of State to heed the warning from my Labour colleague, the First Minister of Wales, that there are necessary and critically important changes that must be made to the Bill.

"However, trade unions are also powerful, well-funded organisations that must accept that power, wealth and influence come with responsibility and accountability. We must therefore balance their rights with those of  working people, communities and businesses that have the right to expect that the services they rely on day in, day out are not disrupted at short notice by strikes supported by only a small proportion of union members.","Alan Mak","Alan Mak"
"A poll by the Federation of Small Businesses found that last year�s strike action on the London underground cost about �600 million in lost hours, lost business, and lost productivity. Across Britain this year, we have again seen the shut-down of the London underground, strikes on ferries in western Scotland, strikes on trains on the First Great Western network, and strikes on buses in Cardiff, with future strikes potentially affecting the rugby world cup.","Alan Mak","Alan Mak"

That negotiation contributes to improved employment practice and improved outcomes for both the workforce and employers.","Hannah Bardell","Hannah Bardell"

"I am so minded by personal experience: when the National Union of Teachers was on strike in 2012, that had an impact on me as a parent. I certainly remember that the turnout was 27% of all members, so the impact on children and parents�my constituents�seemed completely disproportionate to the number who voted in favour of the strike.","Oliver Dowden","Huw Merriman"

Members are perfectly entitled to withdraw their support from the Labour party, as I know many SNP members have done, but the Bill is not the way to deal with that.","Sajid Javid","Owen Thompson"
"The Bill is absolutely wrong. I can think of no other way to put it. The Government need to take a step back, listen to the contributions of Opposition Members, think again and introduce something completely different that respects and moves the trade union movement forward, rather than using a sledgehammer to shut it down.
","Grant Shapps","Owen Thompson"
"My party believes that instead of pursuing further draconian measures aimed at restricting trade union activity, a speedy inquiry on industrial relations and employee rights should be convened to look into the role trade unions should play in a modern economy and the challenges faced by working people, such as zero-hours contracts, low pay and the increasing lack of workplace rights.","Margaret Greenwood","Jonathan Edwards"
"The Bill has been labelled the biggest attack on trade union activity for 30 years and follows a long line of anti-trade union laws brought in by Conservative Governments, most of which were not overturned by Labour Governments between 1997 and 2010.
","Andy McDonald","Jonathan Edwards"
"The Bill aims to make it more difficult to take industrial action by forcing unions to give further notice before striking, introducing even higher thresholds for successful strike ballots and further restricting the right to picket. I note from elsewhere�this is critical to how the Bill will work�that the Government are minded to allow employers to bring in agency workers in the event of a strike. They are consulting on that currently. The Bill will undermine facility time, which will reduce the ability of union officials to represent their members at work.

"It will come as no surprise to anyone who has heard the Tories� poisonous rhetoric towards trade unions that this Bill should seek to undermine workers� rights.

"It is clear that trade unions can play a vital role, so why are enclaves of radicalism such as the British Medical Association, the Headmasters� and Headmistresses� Conference, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Nursing and the Society of Authors being attacked in this way?","Dennis Skinner","Justin Madders"
"There appears to be no requirement for the union member to have any particular interest in the order. It is like saying to a Tesco Clubcard member, �You can collect a fine imposed by the Office of Fair Trading.� What perceived problem is that provision intended to deal with? Is the certification officer not capable of enforcing his own orders? The Bill imposes a whole new layer of bureaucracy and burdens on trade unions. Whatever happened to the red tape challenge?","Angela Eagle","Justin Madders"
"Let me end by saying that there is absolutely nothing in the Bill that we can commend. There is nothing in it to tackle the industrial relations challenges that we face, and nothing to protect centuries-old principles of justice and confidentiality. Instead, we have been presented with a cynical and pernicious Bill that should be consigned to the dark recesses of prejudice whence it came.","Justin Madders","Justin Madders"

�Applied to any type of protest these proposals would be a mark of an authoritarian and controlling Government.�","Angela Eagle","Clive Lewis"
"This Bill fails all four tests. The three clearest examples are: treating abstentions as no votes, which is clearly against the international standard and the international norm, putting greater restrictions on public services, a category drawn much more broadly than the international community would permit, and the unjustifiable restrictions on rights of protest both in picketing and away from picketing.","Lisa Cameron","Keir Starmer"
"Given the way in which the Government talk about check-off and facility agreements, anyone would think that those were statutory requirements from which employers needed to be freed. They are, however, voluntary  arrangements that are freely entered into between employers and employees. If I am running a business, what right do this Government have to tell me how I should consult and involve my employees in that business?","Gregory Stafford","Tommy Sheppard"
" This Bill, like so many others, rips up the constitution in favour of a naked political attack. It is an attack on the ability of trade unions and their members to have a say in politics, just at the time when it has never been more important that working people have a voice.

It is for that reason that I will oppose this Bill this evening, and I urge Government Members to do the same.","Grahame Morris","Cat Smith"

"Everyone knows there is no love lost between the Tory party and the trade union movement, but for the Government to play politics with some of the basic rights of those who have a difference of opinion with them, just because they can, is, frankly, an abuse of power.","Sajid Javid","Harry Harpham"
"As others have noted, the ability to form a union and carry out industrial action are basic rights in a democratic society. I am very concerned that the Government have introduced a Bill that seeks to undermine such fundamental rights.
","Chris Stephens","Kate Osamor"
"Unionised workplaces are also more likely to have good policies on flexible working and maternity pay, as well as better support for those returning to work after pregnancy. By making it harder for workers to organise at work, this Bill will have a negative impact on all those areas, leading to further discrimination against women in work.","Kate Osamor","Kate Osamor"

"This is a regressive Bill that threatens to undermine basic civil rights and reverse progress in achieving workplace equality. I urge Members on both sides of the House who do not want to see that progress reversed to vote against the Bill.","Angela Eagle","Kate Osamor"
"What the Bill in fact offers, contrary to what we have heard from Opposition Members, is a set of protections for two sets of working people: those who utterly depend on public services for their everyday lives and those who work in public services and find that they are often engaged in pointless, costly strike action because of the actions of a politically motivated minority.","Rishi Sunak","Boris Johnson"

"The Bill stands alone as a divisive and offensive piece of legislation, but when viewed alongside the Government�s wider agenda of scrapping the Human Rights Act, introducing fees denying women the chance to sue for equal pay, slashing legal aid, attempting to limit freedom of information and judicial review powers, disfranchising millions through ill-thought-out changes to electoral registration and the Act that has gagged charities and civil society organisations, it is deeply sinister and it should sound the alarm bell from town to town and city to city across this nation of hard-won liberties in the year we celebrate the anniversary of Magna Carta.","Clive Lewis","Stephen Doughty"
"It is nothing more than a naked partisan attempt to prevent scrutiny of the Government and their agenda. Not since the 1970s have we seen such wide-ranging attempts to change industrial relations law, but today we see barely a hundredth of the level of industrial action of those days. The Bill seeks to solve a problem that simply does not exist. Instead, it seeks to drive a false wedge between Government, industry, employees and the public by restricting rights and, at worst, criminalising people making their views known about their pensions, pay, health and safety and many other issues.","Liz McInnes","Stephen Doughty"
"The Bill will give union members more information about what unions are doing with their money. It will ensure that diverting a union member�s hard-earned cash to a political cause is done only with their explicit assent.","Sajid Javid","Nick Boles"
"The core purpose of the Bill, however, is bigger than that. The purpose is to strike a fairer balance between the rights of unions and their responsibilities towards the rest of society, especially other working people. It asks union leaders to weigh the costs and benefits of calling a strike ballot carefully and to make sure they win the arguments for action convincingly. It ensures that in future unions will only be able to disrupt other people�s lives if their cause has broad support.","Sajid Javid","Nick Boles"
"My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis) raised some concerns about the picketing code, and those concerns were reflected in other speeches, too. I am a little puzzled by those concerns because the clauses in the Bill on picketing were taken directly, word for word, from the code on picketing, a statutory code that has existed since 1992, which the previous Labour Government made no attempt to amend and which no union has ever written to me to ask me to amend.","Stephen Doughty","Nick Boles"

"Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"During recent strike action by the ambulance service—this has been referred to a couple of times, and I want to read it out because it is written down—the NHS has not been reassured by the relevant union that it can rely on the current system of voluntary local derogation, which I think is what the hon<prd> Member for York Central was talking about earlier.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"It could not rely on those arrangements to ensure that patient and public services were provided.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"

"Let us look at what this Bill is really all about: a Government who are out of ideas, out of time and fast running out of sticking plasters; a Government who are playing politics with nurses’ lives because they cannot stomach negotiation; a Government desperately doing all they can to distract from the economic emergency they have caused.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"

"That is what this is all about.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"

"In Scotland, this is further proof that the Westminster straitjacket does us no good at all.","Justin Madders","not_statement"
"We could have had employment and workers’ rights devolved, but, unfortunately, Labour resisted those powers coming to Scotland.","Chris Stephens","not_statement"
"However, even the STUC has now called for the devolution of employment rights to Scotland, so perhaps Labour should consider that, instead of listening to Gordon Brown’s rehash of broken promises.","Kevin Barron","not_statement"
"It is worth noting that the Bill does not impact Northern Ireland, as employment law is already devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, so, yet again, the so-called most powerful devolved Parliament in the world—the Scottish Parliament—has fewer powers than the Northern Ireland Assembly, and this proves it.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"This ideological attack comes from someone who, as Transport Secretary, was non-existent when it came to dialogue and communications, and that was confirmed by the unions.","Kevin Barron","not_statement"
"He was somebody who was blocking the DFT from agreeing deals, and now we have that same person in post leading the charge for anti-strike and anti-worker legislation.","Owen Thompson","not_statement"

"It is utterly insane.","Owen Thompson","not_statement"
"As the rail unions pointed out at the Transport Committee last week, deals have been agreed where DfT and UK Ministers are not involved.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Clearly the union asks cannot be too unreasonable, when RMT and ASLEF have agreed deals with ScotRail and the Scottish Government, deals in Wales and deals with Merseyrail, for example—deals with Governments and authorities that have been hamstrung by the Tory austerity imposed on them, yet still managed to agree deals.","Alex Cunningham","not_statement"
"The Tories tell us they are the party of workers.","Wes Streeting","not_statement"
"That phrase fools no one, but they also tell us they are all about a high-wage, skilled economy.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Yet, as we have heard, when workers ask for a wage rise they are told no, that it is unaffordable; even worse, in the case of the rail unions, the Secretary of State quotes figures that he thinks show how well paid all rail staff are.","Grahame Morris","not_statement"
"That is really telling: the Secretary of State is effectively saying, “Train drivers are overpaid—how dare they ask for a wage rise?","Ian Lavery","not_statement"

"It is the same with the Secretary’s rhetoric about this legislation mirroring what happens elsewhere in Europe.","Rachael Maskell","not_statement"
"His soundbites are easily proven to be false.","Greg Smith","not_statement"
"Indeed, the general secretary of the European Federation of Public Service Unions, Jan Willem Goudriaan, argued that comparison by the UK Government of this Bill with existing laws in other EU countries was misrepresenting the situation, because all minimum service levels in Europe are agreed through negotiation.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Moreover, the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, Esther Lynch, said:  “The UK already has among the most draconian restrictions on the right to strike in Europe, and the UK government’s plans would push it even further away from normal, democratic practice across Europe”.","Angela Eagle","not_statement"
"Pablo Sánchez Centellas, a spokesperson for the EPSU, was much more succinct, saying, “It’s bollocks.","Kate Osamor","not_statement"
"” The Secretary of State should reflect on the true position of this proposed legislation compared with what is happening in Europe.","Ian Lavery","not_statement"
"He has also rightly pointed out that the human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill set out reasons why minimum service levels were not justified in fire services, health settings or education, yet that is what the Government now propose.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"By default, this Government are now going against their own previous human rights opinion.","Clive Lewis","not_statement"
"What kind of madness is that?","Lisa Cameron","not_statement"
"When it comes to the International Labour Organisation, which the Secretary of State likes to reference, its idea of minimum service requirements is clearly intended to be based on endangerment to life, personal safety or health.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"This wide-ranging legislation goes way beyond those parameters.","Stephen Doughty","not_statement"
"The ILO makes it clear there should be an independent arbitration body, yet this Bill is completely silent on such a body.","Kevin Barron","not_statement"
"Why is that?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"It is also clear that any minimum service level is supposed to be just that—a bare minimum.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"We have no idea what this Government will railroad through via statutory instruments.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"Statutory instruments cannot be amended and the last time a Government was defeated on a statutory instrument was in 1979, so we know all power rests with the Government there.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"As Liberty has observed, the Bill does not create any form of minimal service.","Hannah Bardell","not_statement"
"Liberty also confirms that MPs debating this legislation on Second Reading will not know exactly what they are voting for, so all the Tory MPs in the Chamber who are going to take part in the debate and then trot through the Lobby will do so blind to what the future legislation and regulations on minimum service will look like.","Rachael Maskell","not_statement"
"It is an affront to democracy.","Ian Lavery","not_statement"
"Any Tory MP who claims to care about parliamentary sovereignty cannot possibly vote for this Bill.","Ian Lavery","not_statement"
"The Bill is made worse by the Henry VIII power that allows amendment and revocation even of future legislation not yet passed.","Dawn Butler","not_statement"
"We can see how the Government are ramming this Bill through Parliament with minimum scrutiny and a proposed programme motion allowing just five hours for Committee.","Owen Thompson","not_statement"
"It really is an assault on democracy.","Ian Lavery","not_statement"
"The fact that the Bill comes into effect immediately once passed, so that work notices and actions can be taken by employers for strikes that have already been voted through, shows just how ridiculous this assault on workers is.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"The impact assessment for the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill observes that on a strike day in July 2022, 20% of rail services were still in operation.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Right away that suggests to me that a minimum level of service was operating.","Priti Patel","not_statement"
"What do the Tories really think a minimum service is, if 20% is not a bare minimum?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"There are huge ramifications here for rail workers overall, because if this Government force through a high threshold of minimum service, strikes by signalmen and track operatives will effectively be banned.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"A high minimum service will force all those guys to work to keep the tracks in operation and the trains running, effectively blocking strikes by the back door.","Angela Rayner","not_statement"
"What will minimum service look like for teachers?","Chris Philp","not_statement"
"Where does that fit in with all the talk about safety?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"What happens to train companies that cannot provide a minimum service at the moment, especially if union members decide not to work on their rest days and to work to rule?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Where will that leave this Government on minimum service level obligations?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"The overview in the explanatory notes makes it clear that the ability to sack workers is a key aspect of the Bill.","Alan Brown","not_statement"
"That is the polar opposite of what was said when a transport strike Bill was listed in the Queen’s Speech in December 2019, when it was stated that workers would not be discriminated against.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Why are the Government now threatening people’s livelihoods?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"How can that be deemed acceptable?","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"The sacking aspect is the proof that this is nothing to do with minimum cover by ambulance staff, as the Secretary of State likes to tell us.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"For fire services, the Secretary of State could also utilise the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, if he felt the desire to do so.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"It is crystal clear that this legislation is not required.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"It is an attack on democracy and the right to strike; it will prolong industrial disputes, not resolve them; it will allow individual workers to be targeted through work notices; and it is politically stupid.","Geraint Davies","not_statement"
"We have to wonder why this Tory Government are looking to antagonise something like 7 million workers across these sectors.","Alex Cunningham","not_statement"
"The public can see through a Government who partied while clapping the nurses and now threaten them with the sack.","Owen Thompson","not_statement"
"They should follow the lead of the Scottish Government and get around the negotiating table.","Kevin Barron","not_statement"
"The resolution of the ScotRail dispute has been commended by both the RMT and ASLEF.","Chris Philp","not_statement"
"There are no strikes planned in the health service in Scotland and the pay deal being implemented by the Scottish Government is one that the UK Government should replicate as a starting point when they get around the negotiating table.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"It is outrageous that the Scottish Government, who have been negotiating in good faith with the unions, will now have this legislation foisted upon them—legislation that Westminster could use to force work notices through in Scotland against the wishes of the Scottish Government and that could ruin otherwise good working relationships in Scotland.","Hannah Bardell","not_statement"
"Employment law should be devolved to Scotland, but even that would now just be a sticking plaster.","Justin Madders","not_statement"

"18:49:00  Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con) It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate as Chair of the Transport Committee, and I will focus my comments on that particular sector.","Nick Boles","not_statement"
"Let me say at the outset that I support the objective behind the Bill.","Chris Philp","not_statement"
"It does not strike me as unreasonable to seek a mechanism whereby the right of a worker to strike, which I have no quibble with, is balanced against the equally important right of an individual to go about their daily life, to travel to work, for healthcare, for education, to visit loved ones or for any of the millions of other reasons why people travel about.","Rishi Sunak","not_statement"
"It is therefore appropriate to find a mechanism by which those two rights can be reconciled.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"There are, however, a number of practical issues that I will put on the record.","Nick Boles","not_statement"
"I understand that this is framework legislation and that the detail on how it will operate in the transport sector will follow.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"I was heartened to hear that the consultation on the rail side of transport will be in place before the Bill completes its parliamentary passage.","Michael Meacher","not_statement"
"There are some issues that have to be clarified and resolved before the Bill can properly take effect.","Gregory Stafford","not_statement"
"As has already been alluded to, it is possible in rail, for example, for parts of the system to operate at a minimum level.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"One train an hour could run from London to Manchester instead of three—there are a number of ways to have that reduction in service.","Oliver Dowden","not_statement"
"But some parts of the system are binary: a signal box is either open or closed; and in aviation, an air traffic control centre is either open or closed.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"We need clarity on where the minimum level of service will apply.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"A related point is whether every aviation, railway or bus line and service will have a minimum service or just a percentage of overall capacity.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"There is a trade-off to be made.","Nick Boles","not_statement"
"If another line operates nearby, does that mean that both lines have to operate a minimum service, or would one have a more regular service?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Those are the trade-offs that will have to be made.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"In the current dispute on the railways, Network Rail and the train operating companies have a degree of flexibility in making decisions on which lines and stations will be open.","Priti Patel","not_statement"
"Will what they have to cover now be specified in the regulations, or will they be left with some discretion?","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Dave Doogan (Angus) (SNP) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"Iain Stewart If the hon<prd> Gentleman will forgive me, I have only a minute left and many Members wish to speak.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"My last point is about what will be covered by the definition of “transport services”.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"There are the traditional ones that we all assume will be covered—trains, buses, flights, ferries and the like—but what about some of the other modes of transport, such as cycle hire or taxi services?","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"What does the definition encompass?","Stephen Doughty","not_statement"
"I will ask my Committee, when we meet later this week, if we can usefully contribute to the consultation, but I thought it would be helpful in this part of the debate to set out some of the questions that will have to be addressed as the Bill goes through.","Huw Merriman","not_statement"

"As always, I am grateful to Ministers for taking the time to speak with me directly about Bills in my capacity as Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.","Angela Rayner","not_statement"
"Unfortunately, in a Westminster Hall debate on Thursday, the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the hon<prd> Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), referenced our discussion without giving me advance notice.","Angela Rayner","not_statement"

"—[Official Report, 12 January 2023; Vol.","Liz McInnes","not_statement"
"725, c.","Justin Madders","not_statement"
"372WH.","Justin Madders","not_statement"
"]  Let me be very clear to the House, to the Minister and to my constituents: I am against the Bill and will vote against it this evening.","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"What I said to the Minister was that I—and, I am sure, many people—think it reasonable for there to be a minimum level of service from our emergency services during a period of strike action, and I encouraged him to pursue that via discussion with the relevant services and trade unions, not by threatening them with the prospect of an effective statutory ban on their right to strike.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"When I asked the Minister whether he had sought to achieve that before introducing the legislation, he was unable to fully answer my question.","Liam Byrne","not_statement"
"As we have already heard this evening, the rationale for the Bill is therefore in question.","Geraint Davies","not_statement"
"The Government say that the legislation in place is not effective and that voluntary agreements cannot be sought, but that is not correct.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"Indeed, in signing off the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill and its compliance with the European convention on human rights, even the Government said:  “In the case of other key public services, important factors exist to mitigate the impacts of industrial action”.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"So what has changed?","Oliver Dowden","not_statement"
"As we have already heard, section 240 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it a criminal offence and a breach of employment contract to strike if doing so puts someone’s life in danger or puts them at risk of serious injury.","Chris Stephens","not_statement"
"That is why we have statutory guidance in place across public services, and it is why trade unions put life-and-limb service provision in place when they organise strikes with management.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"On voluntary agreements, in December last year and this month, such agreements have been put in place.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"As far as I am aware—from speaking with striking nurses at Southmead Hospital in my constituency, and later with senior management—there were no problems with those voluntary service arrangements, so the law is in place, voluntary agreements are in place, and there is no rationale for the Bill.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"We can therefore only conclude that it is a negotiating tactic—a threat—by the Government.","Justin Madders","not_statement"
"Lastly, my Committee was disappointed by the lack of time for scrutinising the Bill.","Kevin Barron","not_statement"
"Once again, Ministers have introduced primary legislation with wide-ranging discretionary powers for Ministers without publishing the details of vital secondary legislation in a timely manner.","Dawn Butler","not_statement"
"That is unacceptable.","William Wragg","not_statement"
"It is poor practice for Ministers to bring legislation to the House in that way.","Justin Madders","not_statement"
"As the Regulatory Policy Committee confirmed for me today, the Government are obliged to publish an impact assessment so that that Committee can inform the House of the impact of legislation proposed by Ministers.","Gregory Stafford","not_statement"
"However, Ministers have not given the Regulatory Policy Committee the time to review the Government’s impact assessment and then inform the House about the consequences of the legislation.","Stephen Doughty","not_statement"
"So not only do we have a Bill that has no evidence-based rationale for the need to legislate on voluntary agreements, but we have a Government rushing through the legislation without following due process and without drafting it to the standard that this House requires.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"It is clearly a rushed threat, it is unacceptable and it shows disregard for the House and the job that we have to do as parliamentarians to ensure that the law is passed effectively.","Justin Madders","not_statement"
"To summarise, can the Minister confirm that the Government will publish the statutory instruments and the impact assessment before the Bill finishes its passage through this House?","Sajid Javid","not_statement"
"I politely suggest that he may want to have another go at trying to explain to the House why the Bill is even necessary in the first place.","Grant Shapps","not_statement"
"18:57:00  Saqib Bhatti (Meriden) (Con) I stand to speak in favour of the legislation and to commend the Government for taking this difficult but necessary step.","Rachael Maskell","not_statement"
