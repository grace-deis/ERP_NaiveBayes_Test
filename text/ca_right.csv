"Finally, on the political fund, I believe that the right way forward is proper reform of political funding across the board. It is very difficult to do that without a comprehensive solution.

"Let me move on to thresholds. The whole point of strikes is to cause disruption, but the impact of industrial action on ordinary people�often the very working people whom unions were created to support�is such that it should ever be used only as a last resort. It should be taken only after the explicit backing of a majority of members. That is why this Bill sets a minimum turnout of 50% for industrial action ballots. If 1,000 union members are being asked to participate in a strike, at least 500 of them must vote for the ballot to be valid.",STRIKE,STRIKE

"Those prices going up throughout the rest of the world, including here, has also pushed up wage claims.

"The central feature of the Bill, which should be disturbing right hon. and hon. Members on the Government Benches, is that it is unprecedented, undemocratic and indefensible. Why? Because it gives a vote in trade union ballots to those who have, for whatever reason, decided not to cast their vote, and it classifies that vote in every circumstance as a �no� to industrial action.",GENERAL,STRIKE
"I understand why trade unionism was right, and my father and his father understood it as well�it is because people used to get killed down the pits on a daily basis until the unions came in and fought for members. This Bill undermines that.",GENERAL,GENERAL
"What the Bill in fact offers, contrary to what we have heard from Opposition Members, is a set of protections for two sets of working people: those who utterly depend on public services for their everyday lives and those who work in public services and find that they are often engaged in pointless, costly strike action because of the actions of a politically motivated minority.",STRIKE,STRIKE

" There is no transparency around how much time they spend on union work and no controls in place to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money. It is a situation that most ordinary Britons, including many dedicated public servants I have spoken to, find absolutely baffling. That is why civil service Departments are already required to publish information about the use of facility time by their staff. The Bill allows the Government to make regulations extending that to all public sector employers. It will include information about an employer�s spending on trade union duties and activities and about how many of its union representatives spend a specified percentage of their time on their union role. We have already made considerable savings for the taxpayer by requiring Departments to publish this information, as we have just heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (James Heappey). However, if transparency alone  does not lead to further savings, the Bill also grants Ministers the power to set a cap on the time and money spent on facility time.",GENERAL,GENERAL

"The Bill is not a measured approach to industrial relations, it is a vicious and unprovoked assault on the labour movement. What problem are the Secretary of State and the Prime Minster trying to fix? Have I missed a tsunami of strikes or an outbreak of trade union militancy? The answer is no.",GENERAL,STRIKE

"The Secretary of State discounts e-balloting because of potential fraud. How about considering an amendment to the Bill with regards to balloting in the workplace, where there cannot be any fraud whatsoever? It will be democratised and there will be a huge turnout on every occasion, which is surely what the Secretary of State is seeking to implement.",GENERAL,STRIKE
"Do Members on the Government Benches not see that good employment practices are key to economic competitiveness and social justice? Workers across the UK deserve the right to strike.

"There are extensive new roles for the certification officer, and business would like to be assured that this will not lead to additional disclosure requirements on business in the future. An industrial dispute still has two sides, one may be out on strike but the other side is dealing with that strike.

It is not a reprise of Prime Minister Clement Attlee sending in troops to break up perfectly legal stoppages. It is simply the latest stage in the long journey of modernisation and reform. It will put power in the hands of the mass membership, bring much-needed sunlight to dark corners of the movement, and protect the rights of everyone in this country�those who are union members and those who are not, and those hard-working men and women who are hit hardest by industrial action.",STRIKE,STRIKE

Perhaps that is also why, in 1984, Margaret Thatcher said that the Conservative party should tread with caution before behaving in such a partisan way.",GENERAL,GENERAL

"In this Second Reading debate, we are simply asking the unions to tell us when they are going to withdraw their labour so that we can agree a minimum safety level.",STRIKE,STRIKE
"They seem to miss the point that if unions cannot ballot legally, they lose the opportunity for leadership to hold the pressure cooker together and to conduct disputes in a civilised way with the employer. To lose or discourage that is asking for the kind of wildcat action mentioned by the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.",STRIKE,STRIKE
"He will know, first, that the British people voted for this Bill at the general election and, secondly, that opinion poll after opinion poll has shown broad support for the measures we are discussing today.",GENERAL,GENERAL
"Trade unions are key social partners that play an important role in our society through effective democracy and by helping to ensure good employment practices, which directly promote economic competitiveness and social justice in wider society.",GENERAL,GENERAL
"These measures are entirely sensible and will prevent the abuse of working people.",STATUS,GENERAL
"These proposals are so unreasonable and extreme that they will undoubtedly raise the serious prospect of legal challenge. The interference of the state in the affairs of trade unions is counter to article 11 of the European convention on human rights. We are signatories to the European social charter and as a nation we agreed in article 5 that our national laws would not restrict the freedom of workers to form and join organisations for the protection of their economic and social interests. The Bill directly contravenes our country�s commitment under the charter.",GENERAL,GENERAL
"�Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association",STRIKE, including the right to form and join trade unions��
"�the right of individual labouring men and women to adjust their wages and conditions by collective bargaining",WAGES, including the right to strike�
"In conclusion, I think that the Bill is a reasonable, moderate measure that will protect people from the often very disruptive effects of strike action.",STRIKE,STRIKE
"The Government firmly believe that the ability to strike is an important element of industrial relations in the UK. That ability is rightly protected by law, and we understand that an element of disruption is likely with any strike.",STRIKE,STRIKE
"They are protecting the cohesion of our communities, the standards of living we should all be able to enjoy and the rights of all workers.",WAGES,STRIKE
"We must show ourselves to be reasonable, responsible and, above all, relevant to the needs of the country. Yes, that means reform of the trade unions, but we must be careful not to be seen to erode fundamental rights and liberties of workers who are the foundation of our economy. We must look at measures objectively, and not risk fighting the battles of the past.",GENERAL,GENERAL
"Not only is this legislation a vindictive assault on the basic freedoms of British working people, but it is as empty of detail as it is full of holes.",GENERAL,STRIKE
"But the Bill is not done with offending principles of natural justice. The cumulative impact of the new proposals would mean that the certification officer was responsible for making a complaint, investigating it, reaching a decision, and setting a punishment.",GENERAL,GENERAL
"This Bill seeks to refashion that framework into a set of shackles, leaving unions unable to perform the functions for which they exist.",SECURITY,GENERAL
"The public expect that, and the Government have a responsibility to oversee that and ensure that these levels of services help to protect and safeguard lives, keep our country safe, support the economy and ensure that the British public—the silent, hard-working majority—can go about living their lives in the way that we all want to see.",STRIKE,STRIKE
